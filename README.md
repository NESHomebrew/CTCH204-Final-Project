# CTCH204-Final-Project

As outlined in the syllabus, a significant portion of your grade (40%) is based on a creative programming project. Ultimately what sort of piece you create is up to
you. It may be something static (like a video) or dynamic (like a video). It may have an interactive component or take no user input whatsoever. You may choose to include audio, external images or even interface with some sort of hardware (like an arduino).

- Your project must be entirely your own work (with the exception of libraries and, in some special cases, graphics). Occasionally, you may find a function, block of code or example that is perfect for what you are trying to do -- if you decide to use this you must cite your sources -- otherwise this is plagiarism.

- Your project must be done in processing and should draw on a number of methods discussed in class. You are welcome to use methods that were not discussed in class as well.

- Your projects must be of sufficient complexity to provide a challenge for you and to justify an explanation.

# Story - Trevor's Quest

What is Trevor questing for? A tenured position, essentially some stability. You must apply for jobs and obtain the items required for the applications before the deadlines for each of them run out. You must also remember to do your lectures, mark the assignments, eat, drink, sleep
