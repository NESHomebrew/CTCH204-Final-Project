# CS204-Final-Project

As outlined in the syllabus, a significant portion of your grade (40%) is based on a creative programming project. Ultimately what sort of piece you create is up to
you. It may be something static (like a video) or dynamic (like a video). It may have an interactive component or take no user input whatsoever. You may choose to include audio, external images or even interface with some sort of hardware (like an arduino).

- Your project must be entirely your own work (with the exception of libraries and, in some special cases, graphics). Occasionally, you may find a function, block of code or example that is perfect for what you are trying to do -- if you decide to use this you must cite your sources -- otherwise this is plagiarism.

- Your project must be done in processing and should draw on a number of methods discussed in class. You are welcome to use methods that were not discussed in class as well.

- Your projects must be of sufficient complexity to provide a challenge for you and to justify an explanation.
