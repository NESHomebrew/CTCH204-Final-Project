Trevor's Quest is the culmination of a lifelong desire to create adventure games, and
specifically point and click adventure games. Growing up in the late 80's and early 90's
I was exposed to Adventure series like King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, and Monkey
Island. These games involve controlling a character, collecting items, solving puzzles and
eventually reaching some sort of goal. The Sierra games (KQ, SQ, PQ) were notorious for the
sheer amount of ways you could die. While some people found this frustrating, it made 
finding the correct solution even more rewarding. The Lucasarts games on the other hand
made their games finishable at any point. As a child I've always wanted to create 
an adventure game of my own and perhaps make a combination of both styles of Point and Click.
Allow many deaths, but also keep the player in a state where you can always win. Life tends
to interfere with plans and I have never been able to follow through with those.
 
One aspect of creating an adventure game that always held me back was a graphical
interface. I had dabbled in programming since I was young, but never able to create the
image in my mind and bring it to life on the screen. Using Processing I have been able
to overcome these barriers and create an experience faithful to my vision that I am really 
proud of. While I could definitely use some work in the art department, the simplicity of
Processing has enabled me to build a framework that could easily be enhanced by a more
gifted artist.
 
As with a lot of creative endeavours, Trevor's Quest was inspired by real life. As soon
as I had learned about the final project in this class I knew I wanted to make an
adventure game. Attending these lectures really are the highlight of my week. One week
the lab session was cancelled and we learned how Trevor was going through the interview
process for several different universities to finally put himself in a better 
employment situation. Being a sessional lecturer seems like a tedious situation to be
in. That pretty much sums up the inspiration for the game. Although the demo does not
elaborate on this concept, the framework exists that could now be built upon.
 
The game itself is set to take place over 1 week. During this week, Trevor has a lot
of responsibilities. After all, he is teaching 4 classes with labs, which we are told
isn't humanly possible. In the background it plays Lo-Fi hip-hop music. It will be your
job to successfully find all items required to submit his job applications, as well as
remembering to do all the lectures/labs, eat, and sleep. The scene in the demo is the
room which Trevor does his teaching. I've tried my hardest to accurately recreate the 
random chaos that is this room, gleaning bits and pieces of information gathered from
attending lectures and studying live recordings. In a full version of the game, the 
intent is to include video footage of memorable quotes as "character portraits" which
are very common in adventure games. As well, a variety of sound clips and mannerisms to
enhance the gameplay experience. At the end of the 7 days, if you managed to keep him
alive, and all the items have been collected he gets the job.
 
This game fits with my previous game for this class. YQR Bus simulator was also inspired
by conversations that happened during class. These works are meant to invoke a strong
sense of nostalgia and joy while playing them. You are transported back with each
reference to the hilarious conversations, disruptions and randomness that makes attending 
these lectures so memorable.

My hope is that people who play this game will get a glimpse into the experiences a few
of us get to experience under the instruction of Dr. Tomesh. As students we often
neglect to realize that our instructors are also real people dealing with real problems.
It's a misconception that those in authority have their shit together any more than the
rest of us. Trevor opens himself up to his students and shares his thoughts and invokes
discussions like no other teachers I have experienced. He is a remarkable asset to the
University of Regina and I hope this fact is soon recognized.
